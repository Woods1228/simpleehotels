(5%) Database indexes: Implement at least 3 indexes on the relations of your database and 
justify why you have chosen these indexes: explain what type of queries and data updates you 
are expecting on your database and how these indexes are useful to accelerate querying of the 
database.  

Index hold references that allow the database to quickly find rows in table without the requirement to scan
through each row


CREATE INDEX index_room_key ON rooms(room_num, address);

Improves queries that join/filter based on room identity and location(address). 
Booking and renting operations will be improved as they require certain locations (hotel locations) and room numbers.
Joins between rooms, bookings and renting will be improved
Where clauses that filter room number and address
Exist subqueries checking for room availablity 
Index created as a lot of queries are made for that join booking renting and rooms which deal with large tables and it is better if the querying becomes faster

This index improves queries that filter/join based on room number and address. Booking and Renting requires finding specific room  in specific hotel ( moslty for availablilty checks) --> increases speeds



CREATE INDEX index_customer_ssn ON customer(ssn);

SSN is the primary way to find customers in bookings and rentings
The index is useful for joining customers with booking, renting or payment
help with quickly finding customers to validate when booking and renting
also for locating customers when checking history and performing updates and deletes



CREATE INDEX index_booking_dates ON booking(start_date, end_date);

increases search time to find which rooms are free --> avoids scanning full table
Commonly used to find room availability within the certain date range
